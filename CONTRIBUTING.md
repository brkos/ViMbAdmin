# How to contribute

Third-party patches are welcomed for adding functionality, fixing bugs and just correcting typos on ViMbAdmin.

We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes but there are a few guidelines that we  
need contributors to follow so that we can accept them.



## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that
    branch.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master; `git checkout -b
    fix/master/my_contribution master`. Please avoid working directly on the
    `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure your commit messages reference issue numbers where appropriate.


## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository in the inex organisation.
* In the pull request, state your agreement to the [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/opensolutions/ViMbAdmin/wiki/Contributor-License-Agreement).
